Code must do the following:
	Determine whether the patient is eating or fasting.
	Look at current blood sugar level
	If the patient is hyperglycemic, begin the timer.
	If the patient returns to normal, reset the timer.
	If the patient is hypoglycemic, begin the timer.
	If the patient returns to normal, reset the timer.
	If the patient jumps from hypoglycemic to hyperglycemic or vice versa, alert authorities.
	If the timer goes past a set value, alert authorities.

Proposed functions:
	setThreshold: Sets threshold (acceptable distance from norm). This defaults to 5.
	setHealthyRange: Sets healthy values depending on patient's eating, fasting status.
	checkBloodSugar: Checks current blood sugar and classifies it as hypo, healthy, or hyper.
	compareBloodSugars: If high-high or low-low, add to timer. If healthy, stop timer. If 						low-high or high-low, jump to emergency.
	emergency: If timer exceeds time limit (ex. 1 hr) or blood sugar is spiking, alert authorities.

Written functions:
	setThreshold
	setHealthyRange(eating)
	checkBloodSugar(currentBloodSugar)
	emergency(state)
